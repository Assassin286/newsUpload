#    newsUpload.sh - Backup files to UseNet
#
#    This script automates the encryption, rar'ing and par'ing of Usenet
#     postings. It can be scheduled with cron to run daily. It is advisable
#     to use a long encryption password since everyone can download your 
#     backup and try to bruteforce it. The encryption cipher used is approved
#     by the NSA for 'top secret'-classified documents, and should be
#     sufficient for personal use.
#
#    Usage:
#     1. Configure the variables in the script
#     2. Run the script with two arguments:
#         1. the name of the file you want to upload (single file, use tar)
#         2. the name of the posting you want to use in the usenet upload
#
#    Example:
#     ./newsUpload.sh photoAlbum.tgz username-photoAlbum
#
#    If the upload was succesfull (no errors, check logfile), your upload
#     should appear on sites like binsearch.net and nzbindex.nl after 20-30
#     minutes. You can then download/par/unrar the files with your normal news
#     download program and decrypt the files using the following command:
#
#     $ openssl enc -d -salt -in <filename>.enc -out <filename>
#
#    Dependencies:
#     - rar (tested with RAR 3.93)
#     - par2 (tested with par2cmdline 0.4)
#     - openssl (tested with OpenSSL 0.9.8o)
#     - newspost (tested with newspost 2.1.1, http://newspost.unixcab.org)
#
#    Variables used in the script:
#     TMPDIR - Temporary directory where the script can put the generated
#               rar and par files. This directory should have enough space for
#               the file to be uploaded + 10 % (par files)
#
#     LOGFILE - Path to a logfile, should be writable
# 
#     ENCPW - Password used for the OpenSSL encryption. Please use a very long
#              string as everyone can download your file and try to bruteforce
#
#     NEWSSERVER - Hostname or IP address of your newsserver
#
#     NEWSUSER - Optional - Username to be used with your newsserver
#
#     NEWSPASS - Optional - Password to be used with your newsserver
#
#     NEWSMAIL - Mail address used in the From: field for the Usenet postings
#
#     NEWSGROUP - Newsgroup to post to
#
